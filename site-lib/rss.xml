There are some examples of players, items, etc., in here to help you get a sense of how things are going to look and work before you start plugging your own creations in. This plugin (which you just installed) will allow me to update the toolkit from afar, bringing you fixes and improvements with only the click of a button on your part. So, be sure to keep an eye on that plugin and update the toolkit when it tells you to!<br>The plugin also has a number of other little functions that give you some more control over how the toolkit is managed in your vault. For a breakdown of all the abilities, you can visit the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Toolkit+Plugin" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Toolkit+Plugin" target="_self">plugin page</a>. <br>The toolkit is ready to be populated with all your great ideas and adventures and disappointingly short session notes. So start creating! If you're new to obsidian and still need to get your sea legs, you'll find useful information in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Obsidian+Quick+Start+Guide" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Obsidian+Quick+Start+Guide" target="_self">Quick Start Guide</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Obsidian+Basics+and+Glossary" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Obsidian+Basics+and+Glossary" target="_self">Glossary of Obsidian Stuff</a> on the website. <br>When you're ready, head over to the <a data-href="Omninomicon" href="adventures/omninomicon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Omninomicon</a> and create your first adventure!<br>I'm constantly expanding and evolving this toolkit so I'll try to keep announcements as regular and loud as I can. If that fails, the front page of the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/VVelcome_" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/VVelcome_" target="_self">website</a> has a changelog and that I'll try to remember to update. Hey if you like what's going on here, consider dropping a tip on my Ko-fi or subscribing to the Patreon (above). It'll go towards supporting Obsidian plugin architects and TTRPG writers and creators and builders, and affording me more time to put in the work it takes to serve these tools to you.

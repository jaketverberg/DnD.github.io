While she appears human, she is clearly something different. She has many items, but only ever 5 at a time. This is due to her stock being held in a pocket dimension. Whenever someone wants to trade, she pulls out her special box of holding and opens it up to the dimension with the items. She doesn't even know what will appear when she opens it.\nWhen the party speaks to Vermun, one player rolls a d4. The result determines how many items the entire group can closely inspect together before making a purchase. Items are inspected one at a time. For each item, Vermun provides a brief description and the price (and a visual description is provided to the players). If they would like, a player can roll a 15 arcana check to know the name and the details. This uses up one of the checks from the d4 roll at the start.\nAfter inspecting an item, the group must decide whether to buy it or pass. If they choose to pass, the item goes back into Vermun’s box and is no longer available for purchase during that session. If they use up all their inspections and have not purchased an item, they must either leave without buying or make a blind purchase from the remaining items.\nEach person can only possess one item bought from the store at a time.\nMust roll a 10 Arcana to know more about something you have already learned about\nAny items previously purchased form Vermun can also be returned for the price they were bought, but only for store credit.

There are some examples of players, items, etc., in here to help you get a sense of how things are going to look and work before you start plugging your own creations in. This plugin (which you just installed) will allow me to update the toolkit from afar, bringing you fixes and improvements with only the click of a button on your part. So, be sure to keep an eye on that plugin and update the toolkit when it tells you to!<br>The plugin also has a number of other little functions that give you some more control over how the toolkit is managed in your vault. For a breakdown of all the abilities, you can visit the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Toolkit+Plugin\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Toolkit+Plugin\" target=\"_self\">plugin page</a>. <br>The toolkit is ready to be populated with all your great ideas and adventures and disappointingly short session notes.
